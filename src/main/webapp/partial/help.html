  <h2>Not logged in user</h2>
  <p>You are not logged in. If you only want to view a queue, that's cool, but to
  be able to join a queue, you will need to <a href="#/login">log in</a>.</p>

  <h4>Viewing a queue</h4>
  <p>
    If you don't want to log in, you can open up any queue and see the virtual line of eagerly waiting people.
    This is done by clicking the name of the queue you want to look at in the <a href="#/queues">Queues</a> page.
  </p>
  <p>For example, if you want to look at the queue for <em>Allm&aumlnhandledning</em>, you click like this:</p>
  <img src="images/help/allmanhand.png" alt="Allm&aumlnhandledning">
</div>

<!-- Admin -->
<div class="panel" ng-if="users.current.admin">
  <h2>Admin functions</h2>

  <h3>Adding an administrator</h3>
  <p>
    To add an administrator, go to the <em><a href="#/admin">Admin</a></em> page. Then enter the name of the
    user you wish add as administrator in the field under <em>Admin administration</em> and click <em>Add</em>.
    The user should now show up in the admin list. If not, please refresh the page.
  </p>

  <h3>Removing an administrator</h3>
  <p>
    To remove an administrator, go to the <em><a href="#/admin">Admin</a></em> page. Then, under
    <em>Admin administration</em>, click the remove button beside the name of the administrator you wish to remove.
    The user should now disappear from the admin list. If not, please refresh the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that there must always be at least one administrator. It is therefor not possible to remove
    an administrator if it is the last administrator.

  <h3 id="find-a-queue">Find a queue</h3>
  <p>
    The first step to queueing would be to find the queue you wish to join, right? So how is that done?
    Well, first go to the <em><a href="#/queues">Queues page</a></em>. There you can either scroll to find the queue
    you are searching for, or you could search for the queue. To scroll, just scroll - more info on scrolling
    will not be covered in this help section. To search for a queue, type the queue name (or parts of the queue name)
    in the box that looks like this:
    <img src="images/help/find-queues-box.png" alt="Find Queues box">
  </p>

  <h3>Join a queue</h3>
  <p>
    To join a queue, you will first need to find the queue (see <em><a href="#/help/#find-a-queue">Find a queue</a></em>). When you have found
    the queue, let's say you want to join the queue <em>Allm&aumlnhandledning</em>, click the queue name.
  </p>
  <img src="images/help/allmanhand.png" alt="Allm&aumlnhandledning">
  <p>
    You now reach the queue page, where all the queueing takes place. If you are at a KTH computer, your
    location will be automatically obtained.
  </p>
  <img src="images/help/location.png" alt="Your location">
  <p>
    If your location is not automatically obtained, please type your location in the location field.
  </p>
  <p>Now click the <em>Join queue</em> button, and you are done!</p>

  <h3>Leave a queue</h3>
  <p>
    To leave a queue, you must first join a queue. If you haven't joined the queue you want to leave, we recommend
    you not joining that queue in the first place. If you already have joined the queue you want to leave, go to that
    queues main page and click the <em>Leave queue</em> button.
