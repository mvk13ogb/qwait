  <h3 id="find-a-queue">Find a queue</h3>
  <p>
    The first step to queueing would be to find the queue you wish to join, right? So how is that done?
    Well, first go to the <a href="#/queues">Queues page</a>. There you can either scroll to find the queue
    you are searching for, or you could search for the queue. To scroll, just scroll - more info on scrolling
    will not be covered in this help section. To search for a queue, type the queue name (or parts of the queue name)
    in the box that looks like this:
    <img src="images/help/find-queues-box.png" alt="Find Queues box">
  </p>

  <h3>Join a queue</h3>
  <p>
    To join a queue, you will first need to find the queue (see <a href="#/help/#find-a-queue">Find a queue</a>). When you have found
    the queue, let's say you want to join the queue <em>Allm&aumlnhandledning</em>, click the queue name.
  </p>
  <img src="images/help/allmanhand.png" alt="Allm&aumlnhandledning">
  <p>
    You now reach the queue page, where all the queueing takes place. If you are at a KTH computer, your
    location will be automatically obtained.
  </p>
  <img src="images/help/location.png" alt="Your location">
  <p>
    If your location is not automatically obtained, please type your location in the location field.
  </p>
  <p>Now click the <em>Join queue</em> button, and you are done!</p>
  <p><em>Note: In the queue list page, the boxes of the queues you are currently queueing in become blue.</em></p>

  <h3>Leave a queue</h3>
  <p>
    To leave a queue, you must first join a queue. If you haven't joined the queue you want to leave, we recommend
    you to not join that queue. If you have already joined the queue you want to leave, go to that
    queues main page and click the <em>Leave queue</em> button.
  </p>
